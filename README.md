This is my first Android app in Kotlin!

Through this project, which also was a mandatory task at school, I got to know how to use the API "Glide", how to switch between activites, converting a value from cm to inches through user input, and to make a list view with an AlertDialog to add new input to the list. 

It was fuuun, but I like xCode and app development for iOS better :)
